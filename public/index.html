<!--
  This is the HTML file which is being served by the development server. 
  If you inspect the source code of the web page in the browser (right click â†’ Show source), this is basically what you see.

  If you look closely, you will see that this file differs slightly from the one in the browser when you view the source: 
  The development server has injected the tag <script defer src="/static/js/bundle.js"></script>. 
  This is the compiled bundle of all the TS other code in the application.

  This is the file you want if you make changes to the page's metadata, like the title, favicon, or description.
